# Lahmers_CSCI2270_FinalProject
This program is a workout log that uses linked lists to store data. The program starts with a display menu. Options 1, 2, and 3 deal with inserting, deleting, and printing workouts respectively using a linked list with previous and next pointers. The program asks for the date, exercise, sets, reps and weight of a certain workout and stores all the data in a single node. Options 4 and 5 are used for storing personal records (PRs) and viewing pervious PRs in a linked list with only next pointers. Personal records are stored for certain exercises and changed if the weight entered the next time increase. Option 6 brings up another display menu with three options. These options do various calculations, 1 and 3 ask for inputs to caluclate values that are not stored, and 2 uses the information stored in the first linked list to make calculations. Running the preogram is simple, when the menu shows, enter a number between 1 and 6 and input the asked values if necessary. To exit the program, enter 7 when the dipslay menu shows up.
